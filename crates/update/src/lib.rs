//! The updater: asks GitHub for the latest release of BIMCraft, compares its tag with the running version, and downloads the
//! file a newer release carries for this kind of install (a [`Target`]), checking it against the SHA-256 digest GitHub gives for
//! it, and against the release's checksum file where there is one, before anything runs it. Only the desktop app uses it: the
//! core, the CLI and the MCP server never phone home.
//!
//! What comes from the network is hostile. A reply is read up to a cap and parsed leniently: a draft, a pre-release, a tag
//! that isn't `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, an asset that isn't exactly the file named for that version and kind of install, or one
//! with no digest or an absurd size is no installer. Where the file is downloaded from is built here from the tag and the
//! name, never read from the reply. The download is held to the size the release lists and hashed as it arrives, and a folder
//! of its own holds it only while every check passes. The network sits behind [`Net`], so the tests use a table of answers.

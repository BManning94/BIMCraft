# BIMCraft: instructions for agents

BIMCraft is a clean-room, pure-Rust BIM application following the Revit workflow, modeled on
[storytold/cadcraft](https://github.com/storytold/cadcraft) (the AutoCAD one). Milestone 1, the headless engine with the CLI
and MCP server, and milestone 2, the egui desktop app, are done. What works and what's missing: [README.md](README.md).

## Rules

- **Never crash.** No `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!` or `unreachable!` outside tests (the workspace
  lints deny them), and no `unsafe`. Parameters, files and MCP input are hostile: check that numbers are finite and in range,
  and cap sizes (`MAX_POINTS`, `MAX_TEXT`, `MAX_COORD`, `MAX_FILE`). `Session::execute` runs every command under
  `catch_unwind` and restores the model on any failure; `hostile_params_never_panic_or_break_the_model` sweeps every command.
- **Everything is a command** (`ALL` in `crates/core/src/commands.rs`): an id after Revit's tool name, a Revit-style shortcut,
  a params doc written for agents, and a JSON `run`. The CLI, scripts and MCP all go through `Session::execute`, so new
  behaviour is a new command or parameter, with a test.
- **Validate in one place.** Commands build elements; `Model::check` validates the whole model after each command and the
  engine rolls back when it fails. New rules go there, with an error that says what to fix.
- **Clean-room.** Never copy Autodesk content: no families (`.rfa`), templates, icons, help text, or anything from inside
  `.rvt` files. Formats come from public specifications (IFC4 is ISO 16739). Assets are original or openly licensed; the
  lettering is drawn in code (`font.rs`).
- **The core has no UI.** `bimcraft-core` must not depend on a UI toolkit, so front ends stay swappable.
- **The UI is thin.** `crates/ui-egui` reads `session.model` and changes it only through `Session::execute`, never by editing
  the model. Logic any front end needs (what a plan shows, what's under the cursor) belongs in the core: the canvas draws
  `render::draw` and picks with `Drawing::pick`. UI behaviour is tested with egui_kittest: clicks at model points
  (`BimApp::screen`), buttons by label, keys (`crates/ui-egui/src/tests.rs`).
- **Test first.** Write the failing test, watch it fail, then write the code. Drawings and IFC are tested through their output:
  pixels of the PNG, entity references in the STEP file.

## Before you finish

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

## Looking at the result

- Desktop: `cargo run -p bimcraft -- --sample` (it needs a display; egui 0.36 needs Rust 1.95). After a UI change, look at a
  screenshot of the window, in both themes (View > Dark Mode). Without a display, egui_kittest's `wgpu` feature renders a `Harness` to an image; with no GPU,
  `WGPU_BACKEND=gl` falls back to Mesa's software renderer.
- Plans: `bimcraft-cli run --sample --save /tmp/plan.png`, then read the PNG. After any drawing change, look at it. A level's
  reflected ceiling plan: `render {"view": "Level 1", "ceiling": true, "path": "/tmp/rcp.png"}`.
- 3D: `bimcraft-cli run --sample --cmd 'render {"view": "{3D}", "path": "/tmp/3d.png"}'` (`azimuth` and `elevation`
  turn it). After touching `view3d.rs`, look at it. Sections and elevations render by name the same way: `"view": "Section 1"`.
- Sheets: `bimcraft-cli run --sample --save /tmp/sheets.pdf` prints every sheet; read them back with poppler (`pdfinfo`,
  `pdftoppm -png`) when it's installed. `render {"view": "A101"}` draws one sheet as a PNG.
- IFC: `bimcraft-cli run --sample --save /tmp/house.ifc`. After touching `ifc.rs`, validate with IfcOpenShell:
  `ifcopenshell.validate.validate(f, logger, express_rules=True)` (needs pytest installed), then build every product's shape
  with `ifcopenshell.geom.create_shape` and compare wall and roof volumes with a hand calculation.
- IFC import: after touching `import.rs` or `step.rs`, open the sample's IFC (`run house.ifc --cmd 'elements {}'`) and
  compare it with the sample, then the same file with its bodies turned into triangle meshes by IfcOpenShell, and a
  building written with IfcOpenShell's API. Render what came in and look at it.

## Conventions

Millimetres; x east, y north, z up. A project's units (`Model::units`, `units.rs`) change only what's shown and typed:
drawings, schedules and the desktop format lengths with `Units::length` and areas with `Units::area`, and read typed
lengths with `Units::parse`; files, JSON and every command stay in millimetres. A project's language (`Model::language`,
`language.rs`) is what its drawings print and what new names come in: the core passes the English word through
`Language::word`. The desktop's own words go through `lang::t` and `lang::tf`, so a new label needs a row in `WORDS` in
`crates/ui-egui/src/lang.rs`, with its Portuguese and its Spanish (the core's words are rows in `language.rs`);
`nothing_a_translated_interface_shows_is_left_in_english` catches a label the table knows that the window forgot to
translate. The core's messages stay English, because agents read them.
Levels have elevations, and a level is its plan: its view range (`Model::plan_range`)
cuts 1200 mm above it unless set, and its crop region bounds what the plan shows. Rooms find their walls at 1200 mm whatever
a plan cuts (`Model::bounding`). In a section or an elevation, points run along its line from its start, and up; on a sheet,
they're paper mm from its bottom left corner; notes and spot elevations live in those terms in their view.
A wall's `start` and `end` are on its location line: its centre line unless `location` says otherwise (`walls::faces`).
Its exterior is to the left of start to end, as in Revit, so walls drawn clockwise face out; a compound type lists its
layers from the exterior in. A curved wall turns `arc` degrees, counter-clockwise positive (`walls::Axis`). Where walls meet,
their faces meet in mitred caps at any angle, and a wall ending on another stops at its face (`walls::cap`); plans, 3D,
sections and IFC all draw that outline (`walls::outline`, `walls::prisms`). Room areas are measured at the walls' centre
lines, run on or back to meet at joins (`walls::centre_line`). An attached top or base follows the lowest of the roof's or
floor's planes where it's over the wall; a mirrored wall runs back the other way. A floor's top is at its level plus `offset`,
or with a slope arrow, there at the arrow's tail and rising `slope` degrees toward its head (`Model::floor_top`); it's its
type's thickness across the slope, so plumb it's thicker. A ceiling's `offset` is its underside. A shaft cuts each floor,
ceiling and roof its span reaches into over its outline, all the way through (`Model::less_shafts`). A stair or a ramp
is runs and landings laid out from its start (`stairs::stair`, `stairs::ramp`): a landing after `at` risers (a ramp's, `at`
mm up), as deep as the runs are wide, the next run turning by its `turn`; a railing on one follows its walk line moved out to
its side (`stairs::railing`), so it goes wherever its host goes. `modify` merges into fields that are objects (JSON Merge Patch), so `{"view_range": {"cut": 1500}}` keeps the rest; an element's own field can't be
called `category`, the tag every element carries.
